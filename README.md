Skeleton-Template-for-PicoCMS
=============================

A mash up of [PicoCMS](http://picocms.org)'s default template with the [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com) responsive framework.

I've done my best to clear out any redundant CSS and markup. It's probably a bit sloppy, but it lets me skip a chunk of work when building a responsive website on top of PicoCMS.
